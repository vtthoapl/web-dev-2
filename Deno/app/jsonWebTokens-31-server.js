/* 
!JWT- JSON web token:
- is a way to transmit info between 2 parties, often used in authentication & authorization.
- A JWT consists 3 parts: a header, a payload & a signature.
- The headers & payload are JSON objects that are base64 encodes.
- A JWT contains claims, which are statements about entity(tyÃ¥ically, the user)- the claim are included in the payload.
-The signature is created by hashing the header & payload with a secret key, which is only known to the server. Using secret key, the server can verify that the token is valid by hashing the header & payload with the secret key & comparing the result with signature.

//An implementation with a JWT middleware and signing of the token payload would look as follows.
